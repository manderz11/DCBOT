# DCBOT
My own discord bot :D
If you want to use this, go into program.cs and enter the path where it is located in
ex. C:/Users/User/Desktop/DCbot
And set your user there aswell or the owner
Feel free to change things!
Dont forget to make a folder called CustomJson and make a json file called Token.json
In there paste {"jsonname":"Token","jsonvalue":"TOKEN HERE"}
If you are using the debug version, put the path as the master folder and create the CustomJson folder there!
